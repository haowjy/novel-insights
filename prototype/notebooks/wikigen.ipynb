    "CHAPTER_CONTENT = '\\'It\\'s not supposed to be like this,\\' I thought, hunched over my phone in the fading afternoon light. My fingers hovered over the screen as if I could somehow intimidate the numbers into change.\\n\\nMy Gyarados—level 40, carefully trained, survivor of multiple gym battles and approximately eight thousand random Pidgey and Mankey encounters—was down to a sliver of health. Across the battlefield, a level 37 Vulpix stared back with pixels that somehow managed to look smug. It had probably practiced that look in the mirror.\\n\\nI\\'d already lost two good Pokemon this past hour. My box was only down to shitty Pokemon. I couldn\\'t lose another. Not now.\\n\\nThe Pokemon Mansion sprawled across my phone screen in all its 8-bit glory, a maze of broken tiles and forgotten experiments. Outside my dorm window, campus life continued its usual Sunday afternoon rhythm—distant voices, someone practicing guitar badly, and the occasional burst of laughter. None were aware I was one critical hit away from losing weeks of careful training.\\n\\nGyarados had been with me since Route 6. Just a Magikarp then, making the same old investment that everyone knows pays off—except this time, with perma-death rules, each level had felt like holding my breath underwater.\\n\\nI could switch in Charizard—my starter, my ace—but the damn thing was already at the level cap. One more fight and it\\'d be benched until after Blaine. Kadabra might one-shot it with Psychic—if it didn\\'t get bodied first. My Dugtrio was a speed stat with hit points at this point, and Nidoking was still fucked up from that double-battle ambush earlier. Then there was the Growlithe I\\'d caught an hour ago, but sending it in would be straight-up murder.\\n\\nFive options. Five ways to lose a teammate. Five—\\n\\nA Discord notification slid down from the top of my screen. My thumb twitched instinctively to swipe it away, but the message caught my eye before I could dismiss it.\\n\\n```\\n\\nBigDKarp: @everyone SHADOW MEWTWO RAID AT LIBRARY GYM\\n\\nBigDKarp: @EVERYONE 10 MIN WINDOW GET HERE NOW\\n\\n```\\n\\nCurious, I tapped the notification to see what the fuss was all about.\\n\\n```\\n\\n[March 22, 2024]\\n\\nRaidenMain2: Hey, anyone hear about the shadow mewtwo event?\\n\\nProfOaksFavStudent: starts next week right?\\n\\nRaidenMain2: Does anyone want to head downtown for it?\\n\\nMissingNo404: Down, what time does the event start?\\n\\n[March 30, 2024]\\n\\nBigDKarp: @everyone SHADOW MEWTWO RAID AT LIBRARY GYM\\n\\nRaidenMain2: holy shit it\\'s on campus?\\n\\nBigDKarp: @EVERYONE 10 MIN WINDOW GET HERE NOW\\n\\nBigDKarp: @everyone SHADOW MEWTWO AT LIBRARY\\n\\nRaidenMain2: @everyone LETS GOOOOO\\n\\nBigDKarp: TEN MINS LEFT\\n\\nProfOaksFavStudent: @AlexTheGreat where u at? we need your Darkrai\\n```\\n\\nI briefly swiped back to the emulator, hesitating over my next move before quickly tapping the menu and saving my state.\\n\\n\\'I\\'ll deal with this later,\\' I decided. Shadow Mewtwo just sounded too cool and the battle wasn\\'t going anywhere. The early spring air bit at my face as I burst from the dorm building, nearly colliding with a cluster of freshmen who hadn\\'t learned that campus sidewalks have their own unwritten rules of navigation.\\n\\nThe library stood sentinel across University Avenue. The crosswalk\\'s red hand blinked its warning—a traffic signal I\\'d normally respect. But the street stretched empty in both directions.\\n\\nMy phone buzzed again.\\n\\n```\\n\\nRaidenMain2: @AlexTheGreat where u at??\\n\\nBigDKarp: 2 min until the raid @everyone HURRY IF YOU WANT SHADOW MEWTWO\\n\\n```\\n\\nMy phone\\'s screen painted my face in blue light as I jogged, the little avatar shuffling across a simplified version of my world—one minute forty-five seconds. The library\\'s Pokestop spun with casual indifference, promising digital treasures that suddenly seemed far less important as a deep mechanical groan vibrated through my bones.\\n\\nA shadow fell across my phone. I looked up—too late, too slow—as steel and chrome filled my vision. Physics asserted itself with elegant simplicity: mass plus velocity equals the end of all your carefully laid plans.\\n\\nMy last thoughts weren\\'t deep or meaningful. Nothing about family, nothing about wasted potential, not even the cosmic irony of dying for a mobile game. Instead, I thought about my Gyarados, frozen in time with that sliver of health, waiting for a command that would never come.\\n\\nThen darkness. Not the dramatic fade-to-black of movies or the peaceful drift of sleep, but a sudden cessation of input, like someone yanked the cartridge out mid-game.\\n\\n-[v.v]-\\n\\nThe darkness didn\\'t last.\\n\\nAwareness returned in fragments, each sensation filtered through amber fluid that pressed against me like thick honey. The world beyond my container was a blur of orange-tinted shadows. I floated, suspended in something that felt thicker than water, almost syrupy against my skin. My lungs should have been burning, demanding air, but they felt eerily still, as if my body had forgotten it needed to breathe.\\n\\nSound reached me in waves, distorted and strange. Everything felt muffled except for the deep vibrations that traveled through the fluid itself, pressing against skin that felt too new, too small, like clothes that had shrunk in the wash. A tremor rippled through my container, and another, each one stronger than the last. Then came a sound that defied description—something between a roar and a thought-given voice, so deep it seemed to resonate in bones I wasn\\'t sure were mine anymore.\\n\\nWhen the container finally gave way, it wasn\\'t gradual. Hairline fractures spiderwebbed across my visible world, transforming the emergency lights into kaleidoscopic fragments. The final crack came sharp and decisive, and suddenly the world was cold air and gravity and sensation that felt too sharp, too real.\\n\\nStrong arms caught me before I could fall—arms that seemed impossibly large, attached to a middle-aged man whose tear-streaked face loomed above me. Everything was wrong, scaled up as if I\\'d somehow shrunk in my moment of unconsciousness. I went to return his embrace instinctively, the way you do when someone is crying and holding you, but the arms that responded to my commands weren\\'t mine. These were delicate things. Pale. Small. Unblemished. Hairless. Just… wrong.\\n\\n\"Amber,\" the giant middle-aged man choked out, his voice thick with emotion. \"You\\'re alive. You\\'re really alive.\"\\n\\nHe pulled back just enough to shrug off his lab coat with shaking hands, wrapping it around my shoulders with gentle urgency. The fabric draped over me like a tent, still warm from his body and carrying a mix of scents—antiseptic, coffee, and something earthy that spoke of long hours in this underground lab. The simple act of covering me seemed to steady him somehow, as if the familiar motion of caring for a child helped anchor him in this impossible moment.\\n\\nMy attempt at speech emerged as a quiet \"Who...?\" and even that single word felt like a betrayal. The voice wasn\\'t mine—too high, too young, distinctly feminine in ways that sent fresh waves of confusion through my already overwhelmed mind.\\n\\nThe tears falling on my face mixed with residual amber fluid, creating trails of warmth that felt impossibly intimate. The man held me like something precious, something miraculous, and through the blur of liquid and tears, I studied his face. There was something familiar there, something I should recognize, but understanding stayed just out of reach.\\n\\nIn my peripheral vision, something caught my eye.\\n\\nA tail. Purple and massive, sweeping through broken equipment with casual, elegant destruction. Trails of violet energy hung in the air behind it, making the world look unstable, and unfinished. And there, suspended in the chaos of its own liberation, was Mewtwo. Not the 8-bit sprite or 3d render of the modern games, but something raw and primal and terrifyingly real. Its form rippled with power that hadn\\'t quite settled into being, each movement carrying the weight of something that existed outside the natural order.\\n\\nOur eyes met, and primal terror froze me in place. Every Pokemon instinct screamed that eye contact meant a battle was about to start—but reality had its own cruel humor. No menu would slide into view, no convenient mechanics would save me. Just raw existence: me in this too-small body that felt like borrowed clothing, facing down a creature that had transcended from pixels to godhood without bothering to include a user manual.\\n\\nTime stretched between us, neither moving, neither breathing. Something flickered in those violet eyes—recognition? Memory?—before reality came crashing back in the form of a torrent of flames that caught Mewtwo in its side. The legendary Pokemon tumbled through the air, its psychic shield materializing like heat shimmer before steadying.\\n\\nThe moment shattered, and pure survival instinct took over.\\n\\n\"We have to go!\" My borrowed voice cracked with urgency as I tugged at the giant man\\'s lab coat. The pieces suddenly clicked into place like a puzzle I hadn\\'t known I was solving—the liquid tank, the legendary Pokémon wreaking havoc above us, this man\\'s tears of joy. This wasn\\'t just any scientist, and I wasn\\'t in just any facility. The reality of my situation hit me with the force of a truck: I was standing in front of Dr. Fuji himself, wearing his dead daughter\\'s form, while the most powerful Pokémon ever created battled it out.\\n\\nDr. Fuji nodded and wiped his tears, though he kept staring at me with a hint of disbelief.\\n\\nHe scooped me up without hesitation, and suddenly the world viewed from his height made everything more alien. The laboratory was in chaos—emergency lights cutting red swaths through steam clouds, while sparks rained from destroyed equipment like artificial stars. The air itself felt wrong, charged with an electric tension that made my skin prickle and my hair stand on end.\\n\\nThrough the mayhem, I caught glimpses of other tanks like mine, now reduced to modern art installations of shattered glass and spilled amber fluid. A security guard\\'s Arcanine launched another stream of flames, catching Mewtwo mid-hover. For all its legendary status, basic physics still applied—the impact slammed it into reinforced concrete hard enough to crack both. Pain flashed across its features, quickly transforming into something darker, something that promised retribution.\\n\\nFor a moment, I thought we were about to witness exactly why the games classified it as being the world’s strongest pokemon. But instead, it glanced between the Arcanine, the damaged wall, and—briefly—at me.\\n\\nThen, with a pulse of psychic energy that shattered every remaining bit of glass in the room, it blasted upward through the ceiling. Moonlight poured in through the new skylight, illuminating the destruction below. Dr. Fuji\\'s arms tightened around me with sudden urgency, pulling me against his chest and tucking my head under his chin. The world compressed to darkness, heartbeats, and the smell of the amber fluid still clinging to his lab coat.\\n\\nSound painted the picture I couldn\\'t see—the thunderous cascade of falling concrete, the crystalline symphony of shattering glass, something that might have been a support beam groaning its way to failure. Through it all, Dr. Fuji\\'s arms remained steady, though I could feel tremors running through him each time something heavy struck nearby.\\n\\nWhen the crashes finally faded to scattered plinks and the occasional distant rumble, Dr. Fuji\\'s grip loosened. I pulled back, blinking in the strange new light. Moonlight streamed through a jagged hole that had once been a ceiling, painting silver highlights on broken equipment and scattered research.\\n\\nAcross the room, reality had stopped trying to make sense. Alarms wailed in competing frequencies—high-pitched containment breach warnings mixing with the deeper drone of structural failure alerts, creating a discordant symphony that made my teeth ache. Through the cacophony, I watched a partially-formed Kadabra variant suddenly glitch into the half-destroyed lab, its too-many-fingers leaving trails of psychic energy in the air, before disappearing again.\\n\\nA pained grunt drew my attention back to Dr. Fuji. He was hunched forward now, one hand pressed against the wall for support while the other still tried to keep me steady. His clothes had been shredded across the back, and through the tears, I could see angry red welts already darkening to bruises where chunks of ceiling had struck. A particularly nasty gash along his shoulder blade was slowly painting his clothes crimson.\\n\\n\"A-Are you alright?\" The question slipped out in my new voice, high and clear and caring in a way that surprised me.\\n\\nDr. Fuji\\'s grunt of pain pulled me back from my daze. He was already reaching for me again, his arms trembling slightly but determined. Despite the chaos—or perhaps because of it—his focus remained entirely on me as if the legendary Pokémon wreaking havoc above us was merely an inconvenience.\\n\\nWe picked our way across what remained of the laboratory floor, my bare feet finding surprising purchase on debris-scattered tiles. The reinforced door hung askew on its hinges, blown outward by Mewtwo\\'s psychic blast. Beyond it, the scene transformed with jarring suddenness—no more clinical white walls or exposed machinery, just the refined interior of what could have been any wealthy estate. Wood paneling replaced sterile steel and ornate light fixtures cast shadows where monitoring equipment should have been.\\n\\nThe hallway held a handful of scientists in various states of panic, their lab coats looking strangely out of place against the mansion\\'s carefully curated aesthetic. Two security guards tried maintaining order while radioing for backup, their professional demeanor cracking under the weight of what they\\'d just witnessed. Through a doorway, someone hurriedly disconnected a hard drive, hands shaking as they worked. Fragments of conversation floated above the chaos...\\n\\n\"...security breach in the east wing, we need...\"\\n\\n\"...containment field\\'s down in Enhancement Lab Three...\"\\n\\n“...Fuji\\'s legendary clone…”\\n\\n\"...the evolution acceleration chamber is overloading...\"\\n\\nThe facility\\'s emergency lighting painted everything in harsh red pulses as we made our way through the corridors, but now real flames were beginning to join the artificial warning lights. Smoke curled along the ceiling in lazy ribbons, and I could feel the temperature rising with each step. The lab coat around my shoulders felt less comforting now, its fabric growing warm from more than just body heat. I couldn\\'t stop staring at Dr. Fuji\\'s back, watching crimson slowly seep through his clothes while orange light from growing fires cast dancing shadows around us. Each step seemed to cost him, though he never loosened his grip on my hand.\\n\\n\"Everything will be different now,\" Dr. Fuji said softly, his voice barely carrying over the crackle of flames behind us. Orange light painted the treeline in false sunset, while smoke curled through branches. \"We can fix it all—our family, our life. Everything.\"\\n'\n",

      "Sound painted the picture I couldn't see—the thunderous cascade of falling concrete, the crystalline symphony of shattering glass, something that might have been a support beam groaning its way to failure. Through it all, Dr. Fuji's arms remained steady, though I could feel tremors running through him each time something heavy struck nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the crashes finally faded to scattered plinks and the occasional distant rumble, Dr. Fuji's grip loosened. I pulled back, blinking in the strange new light. Moonlight streamed through a jagged hole that had once been a ceiling, painting silver highlights on broken equipment and scattered research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the room, reality had stopped trying to make sense. Alarms wailed in competing frequencies—high-pitched containment breach warnings mixing with the deeper drone of structural failure alerts, creating a discordant symphony that made my teeth ache. Through the cacophony, I watched a partially-formed Kadabra variant suddenly glitch into the half-destroyed lab, its too-many-fingers leaving trails of psychic energy in the air, before disappearing again.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pained grunt drew my attention back to Dr. Fuji. He was hunched forward now, one hand pressed against the wall for support while the other still tried to keep me steady. His clothes had been shredded across the back, and through the tears, I could see angry red welts already darkening to bruises where chunks of ceiling had struck. A particularly nasty gash along his shoulder blade was slowly painting his clothes crimson.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A-Are you alright?\" The question slipped out in my new voice, high and clear and caring in a way that surprised me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Fuji's grunt of pain pulled me back from my daze. He was already reaching for me again, his arms trembling slightly but determined. Despite the chaos—or perhaps because of it—his focus remained entirely on me as if the legendary Pokémon wreaking havoc above us was merely an inconvenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "We picked our way across what remained of the laboratory floor, my bare feet finding surprising purchase on debris-scattered tiles. The reinforced door hung askew on its hinges, blown outward by Mewtwo's psychic blast. Beyond it, the scene transformed with jarring suddenness—no more clinical white walls or exposed machinery, just the refined interior of what could have been any wealthy estate. Wood paneling replaced sterile steel and ornate light fixtures cast shadows where monitoring equipment should have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hallway held a handful of scientists in various states of panic, their lab coats looking strangely out of place against the mansion's carefully curated aesthetic. Two security guards tried maintaining order while radioing for backup, their professional demeanor cracking under the weight of what they'd just witnessed. Through a doorway, someone hurriedly disconnected a hard drive, hands shaking as they worked. Fragments of conversation floated above the chaos...\n",

      "\"...security breach in the east wing, we need...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"...containment field's down in Enhancement Lab Three...\"\n",

      "“...Fuji's legendary clone…”\n",
      "\n",
      "\"...the evolution acceleration chamber is overloading...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The facility's emergency lighting painted everything in harsh red pulses as we made our way through the corridors, but now real flames were beginning to join the artificial warning lights. Smoke curled along the ceiling in lazy ribbons, and I could feel the temperature rising with each step. The lab coat around my shoulders felt less comforting now, its fabric growing warm from more than just body heat. I couldn't stop staring at Dr. Fuji's back, watching crimson slowly seep through his clothes while orange light from growing fires cast dancing shadows around us. Each step seemed to cost him, though he never loosened his grip on my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything will be different now,\" Dr. Fuji said softly, his voice barely carrying over the crackle of flames behind us. Orange light painted the treeline in false sunset, while smoke curled through branches. \"We can fix it all—our family, our life. Everything.\"\n",

      "The rank and file of the 5/6 Service Battalion of the Stonewalls knew that “there was another push on,” and that they were moving up somewhere into the push; but beyond that and the usual crop of wild and loose-running rumors they knew nothing. Some of the men had it on the most exact and positive authority that they were for the front line and “first over the parapet”; others on equally positive grounds knew that they were to be in reserve and not in the attack at all; that they were to be in support and follow the first line; that there was to be nothing more than an artillery demonstration and no infantry attack at all; that the French were taking over our line for the attack; that we were taking over the French line. The worst of it was that there were so many tales nobody could believe any of them, but, strangely enough, that did not lessen the eager interest with which each in turn was heard and discussed, or prevent each in turn securing a number of supporters and believers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all the rumors appeared to be agreed that up to now the push had not begun, so far as the infantry were concerned, and also that, as Larry Arundel put it, “judging by the row the guns are making it’s going to be some push when it does come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Stonewalls had been marching up towards the front by easy stages for three days past, and each day as they marched, and, in fact, each hour of this last day, the uproar of artillery fire had grown steadily greater and greater, until now the air trembled to the violent concussions of the guns, the shriek and rumble of the shells, and occasionally to the more thrilling and heart-shaking shriek of an enemy shell, and the crash of its burst in our lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was almost sunset when the Stonewalls swung off the road and halted in and about a little orchard. The lines of an encampment—which was intended for no more than a night’s bivouac—were laid out, and the men unbuckled their straps, laid off their packs, and sank thankfully to easeful positions of rest on the long grass, waiting until the traveling cookers, which on their journey along the road had been preparing the evening meal, were brought up and discharged of their savory contents. But before the meal was served there came an unpleasant interruption, which boded ill for the safety of the night’s camp. A heavy shell rushed overhead, dropped in the field about four hundred yards beyond the camp, burst with a crash and a gush of evil black smoke, a flying torrent of splinters and up-flung earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the men were still watching the slow dispersal of the shell smoke, and passing comments upon how near to them was the line it had taken, another and another shell whooped over them in a prolonged line on the fields beyond. “We seem,” said Larry Arundel, “to have chosen a mighty unhealthy position for to-night’s rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the C.O. has any sense,” retorted his mate, Billy Simson, “he’ll up and off it somewheres out to the flank. We’re in the direct line of those crumps, and if one drops short, it is going to knock the stuffin’ out of a whole heap of us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were talking an artillery subaltern was seen crossing the road and hurrying towards them. “Where is your C.O.?” he asked, when he came to the nearest group.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Over in the orchard, sir,” said Billy Simson. “I’ll show you if you like.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer accepted his pilotage, urging him to hurry, and the two hastened to the orchard, and to a broken-down building in the corner of it, where the officers of the battalion were installing a more or less open-air mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billy Simson lingered long enough to hear the Subaltern introduce himself as from a battery in a position across the road amongst some farm buildings, and to say that his Major had sent him over to warn the infantry that the field they were occupying was in a direct line “regularly strafed” by a heavy German battery every few hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Major said I was to tell you,” went on the Subaltern, “that there are one or two old barns and outbuildings on the farm where we have the battery, and that you might find some sort of shelter for a good few of your men in them; and that we can find room to give you and some of the officers a place to shake down for the night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Simson heard no more than this, but he soon had evidence that the invitation had been accepted.

      "Billy Simson repeated to his particular chums the conversation he had overheard; and the resulting high expectations of a move from the unhealthy locality under the German guns’ line of fire, and of a roof over their heads for the night, were presently fulfilled by an order for the battalion to move company by company. “C” Company presently found itself installed in a commodious barn, with ventilation plentifully provided by a huge hole, obviously broken out by a shell burst, in the one corner, and a roof with tiles liberally smashed and perforated by shrapnel fire. But on the whole the men were well content with the change, partly perhaps because being come of a long generation of house-dwellers they had never become accustomed to the real pleasure of sleeping in the open air, and partly because of that curious and instinctive and wholly misplaced confidence inspired by four walls and a roof as a protection against shell fire.\n",

      "Larry Arundel, aged twenty, was a man of good family, who in civilian days had occupied a seat in his father’s office in London, with the certain prospect before him of a partnership in the firm. Billy Simson was a year or two older, had been educated in a provincial board school, and from the age of fourteen had served successively as errand boy and counter hand in a little suburban “emporium.” The third man, Ben Sneath, age unknown, but probably somewhere about twenty-one to twenty-five, was frankly of the “lower orders”; had picked up a living from the time he was able to walk, in the thousand and one ways that a London street boy finds to his hand. On the roll of “C” Company he was Private Sneath, B, but to the whole of the company—and, in fact, to the whole of the battalion—he was known briefly, but descriptively, as “Pug.” Jefferson Lee, the fourth of the quartette, was an unusual and somewhat singular figure in a British battalion, because, always openly proud of his birthplace, he was seldom called by anything but it—“Kentucky,” or “Kentuck.” His speech, even in the wild jumble of accents and dialects common throughout a mixed battalion, was striking and noticeable for its peculiar softness and slurring intonations, its smooth gentleness, its quiet, drawling level. Being an American, born of many generations of Americans, with no single tie or known relation outside America, he was, in his stained khaki and his place in the fighting ranks of a British regiment, a personal violation of the neutrality of the United States. But the reasons that had brought him from Kentucky to England, with the clear and expressed purpose of enlisting for the war, were very simply explained by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Some of us,” he said gently, “never really agreed with the sinking of liners and the murder of women and children. Some of us were a trifle ashamed to be standing out of this squabble, and when the President told the world that we were ‘too proud to fight,’ I just simply had to prove that it was a statement which did not agree with the traditions of an old Kentucky family. So I came over and enlisted in your army.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The attitude of the four men now as they watched the gunners at work was almost characteristic of each. Larry, who had relatives or friends in most branches of the Service, was able to tell the others something of the methods of modern artillery, and delivered almost a lecturette upon the subject. Billy Simson was frankly bored by this side of the subject, but intensely interested in the noise and the spectacular blinding flash that appeared to leap forth in a twenty-foot wall of flame on the discharge of each gun. Pug found a subject for mirth and quick, bantering jests in the attitudes of the gunners and their movements about the gun, and the stentorian shoutings through a megaphone of the Sergeant-Major from the entrance to a dug-out in the rear of the guns. Lee sat down, leisurely rolled and lit a cigarette, watched the proceedings with interest, and made only a very occasional soft drawled reply to the remarks of the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean to tell me,” said Pug incredulously, breaking in on Arundel’s lecture, “that them fellows is shootin’ off all them shells without ever seein’ what they’re firin’ at? If that is true, I calls it bloomin’ waste.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They do not see their target,” said Arundel, “but they are hitting it every time. You see they aim at something else, and they’re told how much to the right or left of it to shoot, and the range they are to shoot at—it is a bit too complicated to explain properly, but it gets the target all right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wot’s the bloke with the tin trumpet whisperin’ about?” asked Pug. “Looks to me as if he was goin’ to be a casualty with a broke blood-vessel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Passing orders and corrections of fire to the guns,” explained Arundel. “There’s a telephone wire from that dug-out up to somewhere in front, where somebody can see the shells falling, and ’phone back to tell them whether they are over or short, right or left.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s pretty near as good as a Brock’s benefit night,” said Billy Simson; “but I’d want cotton wool plugs in my ears, if I was takin’ up lodgin’s in this street.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The light was beginning to fade by now, but the guns continued to fire in swift rotation, from one end of the battery to the other. They could hear the sharp orders, “One, fire; Two, fire; Three, fire,” could see the gunner on his seat beside each piece jerk back the lever. Instantly the gun flamed a sheet of vivid fire, the piece recoiled violently to the rear between the gunners seated to each side of it, and as the breech moved smoothly back to its position, the hand of one gunner swooped rapidly in after it, grabbed the handle and wrenched open the breech, flinging out the shining brass cartridge case, to fall with a clash and jangle on to the trail of the gun and the other empty cases lying round it. The instant the breech was back in place, another man shot in a fresh shell, the breech swung shut with a sharp, metallic clang, the layer, with his eye pressed close to his sight, juggled for a moment with his hands on shiny brass wheels, lifted one hand to drop it again on the lever, shouted “Ready,” and sat waiting the order to fire. The motions and the action at one gun were exactly and in detail the motions of all. From end to end of the line the flaming wall leaped in turn from each muzzle, the piece jarred backwards, the empty brass case jerked out and fell tinkling; and before it ceased to roll another shell was in place, the breech clanged home, and the gun was ready again.\n",

Some of the men had it on the most exact and positive authority that they were for the front line and “first over the parapet”; others on equally positive grounds knew that they were to be in reserve and not in the attack at all; that they were to be in support and follow the first line; that there was to be nothing more than an artillery demonstration and no infantry attack at all; that the French were taking over our line for the attack; that we were taking over the French line. The worst of it was that there were so many tales nobody could believe any of them, but, strangely enough, that did not lessen the eager interest with which each in turn was heard and discussed, or prevent each in turn securing a number of supporters and believers.\\n\\nBut all the rumors appeared to be agreed that up to now the push had not begun, so far as the infantry were concerned, and also that, as Larry Arundel put it, “judging by the row the guns are making it’s going to be some push when it does come.”\\n\\nThe Stonewalls had been marching up towards the front by easy stages for three days past, and each day as they marched, and, in fact, each hour of this last day, the uproar of artillery fire had grown steadily greater and greater, until now the air trembled to the violent concussions of the guns, the shriek and rumble of the shells, and occasionally to the more thrilling and heart-shaking shriek of an enemy shell, and the crash of its burst in our lines.\\n\\nIt was almost sunset when the Stonewalls swung off the road and halted in and about a little orchard. The lines of an encampment—which was intended for no more than a night’s bivouac—were laid out, and the men unbuckled their straps, laid off their packs, and sank thankfully to easeful positions of rest on the long grass, waiting until the traveling cookers, which on their journey along the road had been preparing the evening meal, were brought up and discharged of their savory contents. But before the meal was served there came an unpleasant interruption, which boded ill for the safety of the night’s camp. A heavy shell rushed overhead, dropped in the field about four hundred yards beyond the camp, burst with a crash and a gush of evil black smoke, a flying torrent of splinters and up-flung earth.\\n\\nWhile the men were still watching the slow dispersal of the shell smoke, and passing comments upon how near to them was the line it had taken, another and another shell whooped over them in a prolonged line on the fields beyond. “We seem,” said Larry Arundel, “to have chosen a mighty unhealthy position for to-night’s rest.”\\n\\n“If the C.O. has any sense,” retorted his mate, Billy Simson, “he’ll up and off it somewheres out to the flank. We’re in the direct line of those crumps, and if one drops short, it is going to knock the stuffin’ out of a whole heap of us.”\\n\\nWhile they were talking an artillery subaltern was seen crossing the road and hurrying towards them. “Where is your C.O.?” he asked, when he came to the nearest group.\\n\\n“Over in the orchard, sir,” said Billy Simson. “I’ll show you if you like.”\\n\\nThe officer accepted his pilotage, urging him to hurry, and the two hastened to the orchard, and to a broken-down building in the corner of it, where the officers of the battalion were installing a more or less open-air mess.\\n\\nBilly Simson lingered long enough to hear the Subaltern introduce himself as from a battery in a position across the road amongst some farm buildings, and to say that his Major had sent him over to warn the infantry that the field they were occupying was in a direct line “regularly strafed” by a heavy German battery every few hours.\\n\\n“My Major said I was to tell you,” went on the Subaltern, “that there are one or two old barns and outbuildings on the farm where we have the battery, and that you might find some sort of shelter for a good few of your men in them; and that we can find room to give you and some of the officers a place to shake down for the night.”\\n\\nSimson heard no more than this, but he soon had evidence that the invitation had been accepted. The battalion was warned to “stand by” for a move across the road, and the Colonel and Adjutant, with the Sergeant-Major and a couple of Sergeants, left the orchard and disappeared among the farm buildings, in the company of the gunner Subaltern.\\n\\nBilly Simson repeated to his particular chums the conversation he had overheard; and the resulting high expectations of a move from the unhealthy locality under the German guns’ line of fire, and of a roof over their heads for the night, were presently fulfilled by an order for the battalion to move company by company. “C” Company presently found itself installed in a commodious barn, with ventilation plentifully provided by a huge hole, obviously broken out by a shell burst, in the one corner, and a roof with tiles liberally smashed and perforated by shrapnel fire. But on the whole the men were well content with the change, partly perhaps because being come of a long generation of house-dwellers they had never become accustomed to the real pleasure of sleeping in the open air, and partly because of that curious and instinctive and wholly misplaced confidence inspired by four walls and a roof as a protection against shell fire.\\n\\nSomewhere outside and very close to them a field battery was in action, and for a whole hour before darkness fell the air pulsed and the crazy buildings about them shook to an unceasing thump and bang from the firing guns, while the intervals were filled with the slightly more distant but equally constant thud and boom of other batteries’ fire.\\n\\nWhile they were waiting for the evening meal to be served some of the men wandered out and took up a position where they could view closely the guns and gunners at their work. The guns were planted at intervals along a high hedge; the muzzles poked through the leafy screen, and a shelter of leaves and boughs was rigged over each, so as to screen the battery from air observation.\\n\\nBilly Simson and his three particular chums were amongst the interested spectators.

The air is filled with the constant thunder of artillery fire, growing more intense as they near the front.\\n\\nAs the men prepare to set up camp, enemy shells begin to fall dangerously close to their position. An artillery subaltern from a nearby battery warns the battalion\\'s commanding officer about the perilous location. Acting on this information, the battalion is quickly moved to a nearby farm, where they find shelter in barns and outbuildings.\\n\\nThe chapter introduces four main characters: Larry Arundel, Billy Simson, Ben \"Pug\" Sneath, and Jefferson \"Kentucky\" Lee. These men, despite their diverse backgrounds, have formed a close friendship. Their interactions and observations provide insight into the soldiers\\' experiences and perspectives.\\n\\nAs evening falls, some of the men, including the four friends, watch a nearby allied artillery battery in action. The narrative describes in detail the process of loading, firing, and reloading the guns, as well as the communication system used to direct fire. This scene serves to illustrate the scale and complexity of modern warfare, while also providing a moment of relative calm before the impending battle.\\n\\nThe artillery\\'s primary task is revealed to be \"wire cutting\" – the destruction of enemy barbed wire defenses in preparation for an infantry assault. This information, combined with the constant bombardment from both sides, heightens the sense of an imminent and significant offensive.\\n\\nThroughout the chapter, the narrative builds tension by contrasting the soldiers\\' uncertainty about their specific role with the clear signs of impending action. The diverse backgrounds of the characters highlight how the war has brought together men from all walks of life, united in their apprehension and determination as they face the coming conflict.\\n---\\n\\n# JSON Schema for Core Summary\\n\\n```json\\n{\"additionalProperties\": false, \"properties\": {\"genres\": {\"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}, \"title\": \"Genres\", \"type\": \"array\"}, \"setting\": {\"description\": \"Description of the primary setting or world in which the story takes place\", \"title\": \"Setting\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"overall_summary\": {\"description\": \"A detailed summary of the entire story so far, highlighting the main plot developments.

      "\n",
      "The narrative opens with the 5/6 Service Battalion of the Stonewalls marching towards the front lines. The soldiers are aware of an impending offensive but have limited concrete information, leading to widespread speculation and rumors. After three days of marching, the battalion halts in a small orchard as evening approaches. The air is filled with the constant thunder of artillery fire, growing more intense as they near the front.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the men prepare to set up camp, enemy shells begin to fall dangerously close to their position. An artillery subaltern from a nearby battery warns the battalion's commanding officer about the perilous location. Acting on this information, the battalion is quickly moved to a nearby farm, where they find shelter in barns and outbuildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chapter introduces four main characters: Larry Arundel, Billy Simson, Ben \"Pug\" Sneath, and Jefferson \"Kentucky\" Lee. These men, despite their diverse backgrounds, have formed a close friendship. Their interactions and observations provide insight into the soldiers' experiences and perspectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "As evening falls, some of the men, including the four friends, watch a nearby allied artillery battery in action. The narrative describes in detail the process of loading, firing, and reloading the guns, as well as the communication system used to direct fire. This scene serves to illustrate the scale and complexity of modern warfare, while also providing a moment of relative calm before the impending battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The artillery's primary task is revealed to be \"wire cutting\" – the destruction of enemy barbed wire defenses in preparation for an infantry assault. This information, combined with the constant bombardment from both sides, heightens the sense of an imminent and significant offensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the chapter, the narrative builds tension by contrasting the soldiers' uncertainty about their specific role with the clear signs of impending action. The diverse backgrounds of the characters highlight how the war has brought together men from all walks of life, united in their apprehension and determination as they face the coming conflict.\n",
